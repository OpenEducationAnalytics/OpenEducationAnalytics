## Use Case Documentation

The [OEA Use Case Documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/main/docs/use_cases/Open_Education_Analytics_Use_Case_Template_v3.docx) should provide guidance on the end-to-end process of developing a successful Hybrid Engagement use case project. This document includes 
 - defining of the use case problem,
 - key stakeholder identification and engagement in the project,
 - mapping research theory to data,
 - and implementing principles of responsible data and AI. 

<ins> Important Note:</ins> It is strongly recommended to education systems or institutions planning to use this package establish that they establish a process for obtaining student, family, guardian, teacher, faculty, and staff **consent for using this type of student engagement and attendance data**. This consent should be part of the system or institution’s **broader data governance policy** that clearly specifies who can have access to what data, under what conditions, for what purposes, and for what length of time.
