## Use Case Documentation

The [OEA Student Well-being Package - Use Case Documentation]([docs/Predicting%20Student%20Well-Being%20OEA%20Use%20Case%20Documentation.pdf](https://github.com/microsoft/OEA-Predicting-Student-Wellbeing/blob/main/docs/Predicting%20Student%20Well-Being%20OEA%20Use%20Case%20Documentation.pdf)) provides guidance on the end-to-end process of developing a successful Chronic Absenteeism use case project. This document includes 
 - defining of the use case problem,
 - key stakeholder identification and engagement in the project,
 - mapping research theory to data,
 - and implementing principles of responsible data and AI in the process of predictive modeling. 
The use case document was completed in collaboration with through a partnership between Microsoft Education and the Department of Education in Fresno, California.

<ins> Important Note:</ins> It is strongly recommended to education systems or institutions planning to use this package establish that they establish a process for obtaining student, family, guardian, teacher, faculty, and staff **consent for using this type of student well-being data**. This consent should be part of the system or institution’s **broader data governance policy** that clearly specifies who can have access to what data, under what conditions, for what purposes, and for what length of time.

## Package Asset Use Instructions

The Student Well-being Package provides multiple assets to help accelerate the implementation of student well-being predictive models in education.

1. <strong>[Use Case Documentation]([docs/Predicting%20Student%20Well-Being%20OEA%20Use%20Case%20Documentation.pdf](https://github.com/microsoft/OEA-Predicting-Student-Wellbeing/blob/main/docs/Predicting%20Student%20Well-Being%20OEA%20Use%20Case%20Documentation.pdf))</strong> 
      * Engaging key stakeholders at the beginning of any data-driven project is essential. The use case document should be completed at the beginning of all projects to clearly define the problem, identify key stakeholders, connect data to research, and address any ethical concerns. Further, completing this document helps to carefully define the problem and approach.
2. <strong>[Notebooks](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/main/packages/package_catalog/Predicting_Student_Well_Being/notebooks)</strong> 
      * Package notebooks provide example code for standardizing and processing data to make ready for machine learning, as well as Responbile AI and PowerBI dashboards. Notebooks were developed to perform ML model training and post processing, and serving data to AML for downstream RAI and PowerBI dashboard consumption.
3. <strong>[Pipelines](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/main/packages/package_catalog/Predicting_Student_Well_Being/pipelines)</strong> 
      * Sample Synapse Pipeline for data cleaning for each category of data items used in the Tasmania dataset, joining multiple datasets to a main data table ready for ML modeling.
4. <strong>[RAI](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/main/packages/package_catalog/Predicting_Student_Well_Being/rai)</strong> 
      * Example RAI dashboards are showcased as developed with key stakeholders including the [Department of Education in Tasmania, Australia](https://www.decyp.tas.gov.au/).
4. <strong>[PowerBI](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/main/packages/package_catalog/Predicting_Student_Well_Being/powerbi)</strong> 
      * Example PowerBI dashboards are showcased as developed with key stakeholders including the [Department of Education in Tasmania, Australia](https://www.decyp.tas.gov.au/).
