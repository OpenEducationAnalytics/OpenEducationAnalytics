# Power BI Dashboards

The OEA Chronic Absenteeism Package includes example Power BI dashboards which were developed in collaboration with key stakeholders at [Fresno Unified School District](https://www.fresnounified.org/) in Fresno, California. The aim of these dashboards is to:
  - give a district [overview of chronic absence status](#overview-of-chronic-absence),
  - identify the top [drivers (reasons) for chronic absence](#drivers_of_chronic_absence) as explained by the Machine Learning Model,
  - help design school and student [interventions](#intervenction_identification) which are most impactful,
  - and provide a [view for social workers](#social_worker_dashboard) to monitor chronic absense.

## Overview of Chronic Absence

|:--:|
| <b> Summary of the top predictive drivers as identified by the ML model. Drivers can be ranked by count, aggregated by school, or explored for individual student. </b>|

## Intervention Identification

|:--:|
| <b> Visualizations of groups of top drivers aggregated by school. The aim here is to identify groupings of schools which expect to see an increase (or decrease) of chronic absence. </b>|
