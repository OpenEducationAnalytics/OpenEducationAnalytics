# Quality Rubric
Modules contributed to OEA are categorized in 2 levels: [Approved](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/main/modules/creation_kit/rubric/approved.md) and [Advanced](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/main/modules/creation_kit/rubric/advanced.md). 

The benchmark for OEA module creation is the Microsoft Graph Reports API module, which meets the requirements for the ‘Advanced’ level. This module can be used as a guideline for creating and submitting a new OEA module.

Check the boxes associated with the requirement of each level to keep track of your progress. To check the box, place an x within the square bracket and save/commit.
Example: 
- [x] Place an x with the box to mark an item as complete. N.B: don't add any extra spaces.
