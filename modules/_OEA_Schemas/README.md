# OEA Schema Standardization

This portion of the repository is intended to build, define, and explain the schema transformations made for OEA standardization (e.g. Caliper, Ed-Fi). 

Currently, packages have been created with some OEA schema standards (i.e. Activity data from stage 2 -> 3). As more standards are defined, the intention is to build in these schema standards at a module level (implemented from stage 1 to stage 2). The folders seen in this section are current OEA schema standards being implemented at a module or package level, with direct references to which standards are being used.
