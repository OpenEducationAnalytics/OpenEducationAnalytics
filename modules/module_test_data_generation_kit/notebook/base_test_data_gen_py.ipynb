        "\r\n",
        "This class notebook primarily leans on the use of the OEA_py class notebook, Faker and random-address python packages to generate 5 base-truth tables:\r\n",
        " 1. **Students**,\r\n",
        " 2. **Schools**,\r\n",
        " 3. **Courses**: general classes offered,\r\n",
        " 4. **Sections**: instructor-specific classes offered, and\r\n",

        " - **gen_base_tables(numstudents, numschools, numenroll, hed_numcourses, ed_level)**: Generates base-truth tables mentioned above. Accepts user-defined number of students, schools, courses and desired education-level of students. Accepted **ed_level** values are:\r\n",
        "    * ```hed``` - generates higher education schools (such as colleges), courses, sections, and higher ed. students with class enrollment.\r\n",
        "    * ```k12``` - generates K-12 schools (elementary, middle, and high schools), courses, sections, and K-12 students with class enrollment.\r\n",
        "    * Under-development:\r\n",
        "        * ```prek``` - for generating pre-kindergarten base-truth tables.\r\n",

        "    * ```k12``` - *numschools*: min of 4. *numenroll*: max of 21.\r\n",
