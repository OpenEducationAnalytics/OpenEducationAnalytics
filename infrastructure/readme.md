# OEA Infrastructure Setup and Maintenance
The core OEA reference architecture is built around Azure Synapse and Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS Gen2).
We currently offer a single setup option which utilizes the Azure CLI for the initial provisioning of the Azure resources needed, however we are working on adding more options in order to:
- Better facilitate sharing within the community, accomodating customers and partners with existing investment/assets in a given approach
- Enable better devops processes utilizing infrastructure-as-code
- Provide a path from a simple starter setup to a full-blown enterprise scale architecture


# Cloud Adoption Framework
The [Cloud Adoption Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/) provides implementation guidance, best practices, and tools that are proven guidance from Microsoft, designed to accelerate your cloud adoption journey.

OEA can get you started quickly, but when determining your overall cloud adoption strategy, the resources you're looking for are found via the Cloud Adoption Framework guidance.
